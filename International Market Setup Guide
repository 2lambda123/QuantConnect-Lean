#Work in Progress

This is a walkthrough that demonstrates how to add support for trading Austalian equities to the Lean project. These are the same steps I followed when configuring this repository to work on Australian equities.

Our goal is to run Lean to trade Australian equities within the Australian equity market. To do this we must do the following:

1) Set up an Australian equity Market -- add to Market.cs, set market hours/holidays, etc

2) Set the currency of Lean to the currency of the base currency of the equities you wish to trade

3) Pipe in data; different for backtesting and live.
